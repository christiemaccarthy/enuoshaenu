The extent of the experience with the PC building side of things is putting GPU's and PCU's into 2 pre-builts, so this was a learning experience for me. Anyway, I was helping my mom do some spring cleaning in the garage and found my dad's old Dell Inspiron 560 from ~2009. I figured I'd upgrade some parts, install Windows 10, and repurpose it into a streaming box for my TV. I bring

As the offshore systems administrator, I wore many hats and had many responsibilities. I setup and maintained pretty much every PC, workstation, server, switch, router, UPS, data collector, etc. on the boat. I also handled data processing for multibeam, sidescan, subbottom, magnetometer, and seismic data. I worked 12 hour days, typically either from noon to midnight or midnight to noon.

Also, I highly recommend using I’m sorry this is a little blank as it’s almost been 10 years ago, but this was my first “opportunity” I was ever approached with. Strangely it’s the only encounter I actually did more than ghost, as in ask questions. I don’t remember the actual name of this company, but I do remember it was a thing and people were warning job applicants not to take a job from them if you were approached. It’s sometime in the fall of 2009. I just graduated with an associates, and I was looking # Part 1 (https://www.reddit.com/r/blankies/comments/978scf/every_video_game_tiein_for_a_blank_check_film/) This is part two of my coverage of every video game tie-in for a film covered on Blank Check, this time all 2016 episodes, aka from Pod Night Shyamacast to Rogue One. So last week I decided no mobile or handheld games because there's just so many for Star Wars but I'm rescinding that because there are a few tie-ins on those markets I wanna share. There's also some absolutely horrible. Poor Steve. If only his luck wasn't so bad. This is but one in a series of circumstances that forced themselves upon poor Steve, and contributed to him, somehow, seemingly through no fault of his own, being charged with murder. Among the others: https://www.reddit.com/r/MakingaMurderer/comments/8ek0zt/bad_luck_steve_sniffing_around/ https://www.reddit.com/r/MakingaMurderer/comments/86y2db/bad_luck_steve_jodi_goes_to_jail/ https://www.reddit.com/r/MakingaMurderer/comments/87ce4o/bad_luck_stev. Response to this. (https://www.reddit.com/r/Gaming4Gamers/comments/7zenev/valve_has_changed/) The games industry is sick. Inside and out, for years now it's been rotting from dozens of problems. An overreliance on mainstream appeal has gnawed at the fabric of originality, with a near-complete lack of new high-budget IP to accompany the change. A slow, steady death of independent thought and ideas has resulted in games like PUBG that, rather than being exceptional, cater to the lowest common.

Basically when creating a Hackintosh there are several executables that modify the EFI partition of a machine in order to let the operating system boot and run properly (notably Clover). These programs are meant to only be run within a virtual machine or on a custom made Hacktintosh machine. However, a user may accidentally run the programs on an authentic Apple-made machine, compromising the partition. When this partition is compromised, major updates In 2009 I was diagnosed with ME (“Myalgic Encephalomyelitis” – no, I can’t pronounce it either), which is a catch-all name for a kind of chronic illness characterised by physical and mental fatigue, random muscle pain and what I can best describe as ‘brain fog’ (more on this aspect later). Prior to this I had always built my own computers, as well as a few for friends and family, but by 2011 I was so ill I couldn’t face the prospect of doing all the necessary research and potential troubleshooti. Okay, hear me out, this isn't the typical whining of "I don't enjoy games anymore, why?" or that sort of thing. I love gaming, have since I was four, and still do now in my thirties. That said, I find more and more these days I find myself retrogaming, going back to old favorites, playing "new to me" games from bygone eras, or indie retro throwback games like Hammerwatch, Abyss Odyssey, or Gauntlet 2014, stuff like that. I mean, heck, right now I'm playing Mega Man Legends for PS1 for the first. Evolutionary theorists propose that female desire for domineering males helped create a patriarchal world. (https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/do-women-want-to-be-oppressed/) In principle, evolutionary psychology, which seeks to understand our behavior in light of the fact that we are products of natural selection, can give us deep insights into ourselves. In practice, the field often reinforces insidious prejudices. That was the theme of my recent column “Darwin Was Sexist What's good Reddit, I wrote a post on this topic a while back on my blog and I received quite a bit of positive feedback. So I thought I'd share it here. (with more detail) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (UPDATE: I've gotten many question about how I've created my Kindle Publishing business so I've created a 6-part video course on it.

I lost my phone in March of this year. I’m a bit of a technophile. It was the latest and greatest Samsung Galaxy smartphone and I adored it. I had a protective case on it, screen protector, and every level of security and encryption you can get. I had the thumbprint scanner set as my password and one failed swipe led to a lockdown that required an account password to reactivate. When I checked my bag after returning from lunch one day, it was gone. I called the diner, I called the bank where. </p>
