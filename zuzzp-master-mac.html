Hi, My MX Master mouse will lag, stutter etc. when i’m using it on my macbook, i’ve tried connecting via bluetooth directly to the mac and to the unifier and it’s pretty much the same, i’ve seen some posts online from a few years ago with people saying they are having the same issue, does anyone know if there has been a fix yet? EDIT: i’ve now discovered that it only happens on my second monitor that’s hooked up. Thanks. Hey guys. I just picked up a Logitech MX Master 2S mouse. I was wondering what some of the best button layouts were for workflow so I been a PC user my whole life and a Mac is just so new to me, when I am playing some games or something I don't want the sound from the game to be so loud but I still need the master volume loud as i need to hear message and FaceTime call from my Mac when I am away from it for a min is there a way to make it have that option I'm running a hackintosh and I want to use my mouse in BIOS which can't be done with bluetooth. I want to revert back to using the receiver but I've had zero luck in getting it to work. Can anyone help? OS X El Capitan / Windows. amp#x200B; I was told it has to be in the same format, and sent as a word document. Is there a way to use Windows-like Word on my Macbook 12inch.

I'm looking for Mac's Miller latest discs. Also if you have Diablo song. It's fire. Thanks a lot! Peace. # THE FARMIES ampnbsp; Whats up everybody, hope Santa spoiled you all, and if he cheaped out then I hope you were able to get something for yourself! You’ve all earned it! The next couple weeks or so the Farmies is going to be a pretty tough track with both the NHL AND World Juniors happening at the same time…so I’m going to link up the last edition I did right below, because I thought it was a fantastic statement game for Zack MacEwen, to make his pitch to be a call-up to the Canucks. I'm not too smart when it comes to names or Homebrew ideas but discussing my first DampD session (https://old.reddit.com/r/DnDGreentext/comments/atz46b/warhammer_rogue/) on r/DnDGreentext lead to some talk about a "MacGyver-esque subclass" for Fighter or something. gt I think a homebrew "weapon master" MacGyver-esque subclass (maybe not for Rogue but it would fit Fighter amazingly) would be awesome. The ability to use multiple different weapons to attack at the same time, give all weapons. I love “My House By The Water” I wish Mac would do a full album We're upgrading from 3750 to 9300 StackWise. We were told (by the previous network admin) that we have to turn all of the switches on at the same time so that they recognize each one in tandem instead of each one thinking it's the only one. This sounds. wrong. We also cannot find any documentation on the matter. Do we have to plug them in to a single source and turn it on all at once or can they stagger on? 6 switches connected with data and power StackWise cables. Each one has already. I have to very annoying issues with my mx master 2s. amp#x200B; 1. Logitech Flow spamming notifications that the other computer is connected 2. Mouse skips even with the unifying receiver. </p>
