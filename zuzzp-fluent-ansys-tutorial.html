                            <p> Hello everyone. Long story short, I am in my last writing class for college, professor gave us freedom to choose whatever, I chose CFD because I have been interested in it, but no real experience. Didn't matter anyway since this paper was going to be research based. Now he said for our presentations we need to create our own visuals. Is there a website or source out there that has code you can plug in to matlab and it creates a cool looking 3d model of flow through a pipe or something 
Hey guys, So I would like to get some guidance on which tutorial I should follow from your experience. I'm going to work with Ansys Fluent for my master thesis, but for preparation I need to complete a subject where I will be doing: - Piping flow (no temperature); - Then we will do another assignment with more parameters like temperature but I still don't know what it is about. Anyway, any recommendations would be nice. Also I have some experience in the Finite Element Method with abaqus Hi, I need to model a 3D pipe for a project in Ansys Fluent. I have no idea where to start and a lot of tutorials online are for 2D projects. I was wondering if anyone knows of any good tutorials for 3D modelling or could give any advice please? Thanks. I am trying to learn CFD simulations on my own using Ansys-Fluent. I would like to know some good resources available online including some free SBD models. I need to start from basics, including meshing and stuff. Seriously, I can't find anything on the internet that will help me even correctly develop a basic problem. There is a plethora of information for liquid fluid flow, but very little available for thermal fluids. Has anyone experienced this? Does anyone think they could point me in the right direction. For any engineer that feels competent enough with the program, I would consider compensation for video tutoring. Just food for though. Help me become a better engineer. Thanks r/askengineers. I'm a university student who is fairly new to CFD and Fluent. I recently began using fluent in a computational heat transfer course; although the course is now over, I'm very interested in becoming a proficient Fluent user. I feel that I've mastered a few of the basics after creating some very simple models (laminar flow through a pipe, turbulent boundary layer over a flat plate, convection in a boundary layer, to name a few). So here are my questions for all of the Fluent junkie's out there. Just a general question about Ansys Fluent, and whether it can handle both mix species flow, and combustion. I’m looking at trying to model a mix species flow that is combusting while moving through a tube from high pressure temperature condition (inlet) to atmospheric conditions (outlet). It would also be ideal if measuring the aeroacoustics ie sound pressure was possible. I’ve been looking around at tutorials and have yet to find one that combines both of these regimes of flow. I would appreci. \ SOLVED\ ! Hi all CFD redditors. amp#x200B; I'm doing a project at university, about Fluid Structure Interaction on a steel cantilever beam, where I will compare results from FSI simulation with a wind tunnel test. amp#x200B; At the moment I am pretty stuck in Ansys, because I can only see a few Fluent results(timesteps from Fluent), and many more timesteps from transient structural. For example; 4 from Fluent and 10 from Transient Structural. amp#x200B; My case looks Hi, this is with regard to some doubts I have about my VAWT project. I had posted about my project here: https://www.reddit.com/r/CFD/comments/acwpwh/how\_to\_simulate\_a\_vawt\_with\_attachments\_in\_ansys/ (https://www.reddit.com/r/CFD/comments/acwpwh/how_to_simulate_a_vawt_with_attachments_in_ansys/) amp#x200B; From what I understand, after simulating any real life VAWT, there should be a net positive moment which acts opposite to the sum of inertia of the rotating parts, friction 
I'm looking to model a small rocket in ANSYS fluent with te intentions of getting surface/ stagnation temps. The flow will go from 0ms up to mach 4, over a time boundary to calculate the temp at a specific time. I've seen multiple tutorials trying to explain with FSI and using a UDF, but is it as simple as checking in post processing after I've selected transient time and tinkered with he constraints? As its only velocity over time. I can't seem to find one concise answer. For context, I am a non-thesis MSME student (coursework only masters) and currently work full time in a non-CFD related engineering field (I test antennas). I understand that I am at a disadvantage not doing a CFD relevant thesis, and I was hoping to compensate by taking the two CFD courses offered by my university. Unfortunate for me, the university "cannot find an instructor to teach the class" and has stopped offering CFD 1 and 2 (I found out yesterday lol). Now, I am trying to figure Hi everyone. I am a mechanical engineering student in the UK and am currently working on a project using ANSYS Fluent to model turbulent flows. I was getting on well using various tutorials and books to create my geometry and then to mesh it. While having the meshing window open I have started to get this weird bug (see screenshots here: https://imgur.com/a/DL1d2fu (https://imgur.com/a/DL1d2fu)) where the viewport turns red. If I minimise the window and re-open it will sometimes revert It is hard to search on google without getting ansys meshing, their tutorials always skip too many steps, and/or their support isn't helpful. For example, just the workflow for meshing a cylinder with some inflation layers? amp#x200B; This takes seconds in Ansys meshing but I'd like to try Fluent meshing since they are obviously pivoting Hi guys, amp#x200B; I have this problem for 1+ month and after countless of youtube tutorials and meshing and fluent guidebook i still cant find what the problem is. So i have to calculate the cl and cd on 3 different naca profiles ( NACA0012, NACA0015, NACA4412) for 8 different aoa. My analysis is 3d. The big problem is that WHATEVER i do to the mesh and whichever model i try to solve it the cl gives me a number of somehting like 0.005 which ofc is undeniably low. I change </p>
